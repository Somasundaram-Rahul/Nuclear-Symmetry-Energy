# Nuclear-Symmetry-Energy
Supplementary material for the paper 'Constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy from asymmetric matter calculations with chiral effective field theory'.

This repository contains the code used to perform the analysis presented in the above paper. 


List of programs:
================

- `EM.py` performs the analysis of the single particle energies and produces the plots stored in the folder `results/effective_mass`.

- `SM_NM.py` performs the analysis of the energy per particle in Symmetric and Neutron matter and produces the plots stored in the folder `results/3_scales`.

- `symmetry_energy.py` calculates the global symmetry energy and creates the corresponding plot stored in the folder `results/esym_esym2`.

- `quadratic_symmetry_energy.py` calculates the quadratic symmetry energy and creates the corresponding plot stored in the folder `results/esym_esym2`.

- `non_quadraticities.py` calculates the non-quadratic contributions to the symmetry energy as well as the final fit residuals and creates the plots stored in the folder `results/non_quadraticities`.

- `crust_core.py` calculates the crust-core transition and produces the plot in the folder `results/crust_core`.

Note: The folder `results/goodness_of_fit` contains the plots presented in the appendix of the paper.
